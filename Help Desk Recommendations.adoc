== Background

Many large enterprises often serve end users and intermediaries with an array of support services. One of Neo Technology's Fortune 500 customers approached out team in search of real-time recommendations to encourage use of their online knowledge base. They needed to be able to point users to the right articles as they loaded each page. 
Neo4j was a natural fit for this project due it the highly connected nature of high efficacy recommendations. 

== Business Problem

* Call center volumes needed to be lowered by improving the efficacy of online self service

* Leverage large amounts of knowledge stored in service cases, solutions, articles, forums, etc.

* Problem resolution times, as well as support costs, needed to be lowered

== Solution and Benefits

* Cases, solutions, articles, etc. continuously scraped for cross-reference links, and represented in Neo4j

* Real-time reading recommendations via Neo4j

* Neo4j Enterprise with HA cluster keep their knowlege base up under enormous load

* The result: customers obtain help faster, with decreased reliance on customer support

== Matching a Message to a Support Case

Which support case best fits our question?

[source, cypher]
----
match (m:Message {question:'Why wont my VPN client work?'})-[:KNOWLEDGE]-(k), (k)-[:KNOWLEDGE]-(s:SupportCase), (k)-[:KNOWLEDGE]-(u:Solution)
with m, count(DISTINCT k) as Shared_Tags, s, u
return m.question as Question, s.name as Support_Case, u.name as Solution, Shared_Tags
order by Shared_Tags
limit 1

//table

== What Support Cases are correlated to which Solutions?

[source, cypher]
----
match (a:SupportCase)-[:KNOWLEDGE]->(k),(b:Solution)-[:KNOWLEDGE]->(k) 
with a, count(DISTINCT k) as tags, b 
return a.name as Support_Case, b.name as Solution, tags
order by tags DESC
limit 3
