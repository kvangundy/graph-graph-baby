With the final installment of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson[Peter Jackson's] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)[Hobbit Trilogy] only a few months away, I decided it would be fun to graph out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien[Tolkien's] novel in Neo4j and try a few different queries to show how a graph database can tell your data's story.

*We're going on a graphy adventure!*

== Domain Model

The following drawing shows the domain model and how it all is connected. I decided to use "event" nodes to help me arrange events in time as well as space. @KennyBastani has a great http://gist.neo4j.org/?github-kbastani%2Fgists%2F%2Fmeta%2FTimeScaleEventMetaModel.adoc[GraphGist] about using Neo4j to model time and related information.

== Graph

We can see that a "story" looks a lot like a rat's nest. Characters are related to actions, are related to sub-plots, are related to descriptions, etc., etc. Cypher allows us to easily parse out where we want to look, what we want to look at, and how those data points are related.

=== Neo4Cartography 

Let's talk about maps.

The spatial domain I've chosen for this gist is a fairly simple one, however the same principals continue to apply over more complex models. A coordinate system can be graphed as a series of relationships between points. For this gist I was only concerned where places were in orientation to one another. E.g., "What direction should I head from The Hobbiton to get to The Lonely Mountain?" North?

This:

image::http://i.imgur.com/q8yKTXR.jpg?1[] 

Becomes:

*"How do I get to the Lonely Mountain via the shortest path?"*

[source,cypher]
----

MATCH (Hobbiton:Location {name:'Hobbiton'}), (LonelyMtn:Location {name:'Lonely Mountain'}), 
Road_to_Smaug = shortestPath((Hobbiton)-[:LOCATED*..15]-(LonelyMtn))

=== Neo4StoryTime

Kevin! I don't have time to read the hobbit, just tell me the story in order using Neo4j.

*"What are the major events and in which chapter did they occur?"*

MATCH (Chapter:Chapter)-[]-(Event:Event)
RETURN Chapter.chap AS Chapter, Chapter.title AS Chapter_Title, Event.Action AS What_Happened
ORDER BY (Chapter.chap)

=== Ordering Specific Events
 
I mentioned earlier that we were using a timeline and a series of event nodes to keep track of what happens when. Obviously using chapters as timeline markers is not as granular as it could be, but for figuring out if Bilbo finds the ring before he spies on Smaug it works well enough. 

*"Which happened first,* 'Bilbo Finds the Ring' *or* 'Bilbo Spies on Smaug'*?"*

MATCH
(FTR:Event { Action:'Bilbo Finds the One Ring' })-[]-(F_Chap:Chapter),
(SPY:Event { Action:'Bilbo Spies on Smaug' })-[]-(S_Chap:Chapter)
RETURN FTR.Action, F_Chap.chap AS Find_Chapter, SPY.Action , S_Chap.chap AS Spy_Chapter
ORDER BY F_Chap.chap

----
//table

We see that in Chapter 5 Bilbo finds the ring and not until Chapter 12 does he spy on Smaug.

=== The End.
